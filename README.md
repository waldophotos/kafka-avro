# kafka-avro

> Node.js bindings for librdkafka with Avro schema serialization.

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/waldophotos/kafka-avro/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/waldophotos/kafka-avro/tree/master)

The kafka-avro library is a wrapper that combines the [node-rdkafka][node-rdkafka] and [avsc][avsc] libraries to allow for Production and Consumption of messages on kafka validated and serialized by Avro.

## Install

Install the module using NPM:

```
npm install kafka-avro --save
```

## Documentation

The kafka-avro library operates in the following steps:

1. You provide your Kafka Brokers and Schema Registry (SR) Url to a new instance of kafka-avro.
1. You initialize kafka-avro, that will tell the library to query the SR for all registered schemas, evaluate and store them in runtime memory.
1. kafka-avro will then expose the `getConsumer()` and `getProducer()` methods, which both return instances of the corresponding Constructors from the [node-rdkafka][node-rdkafka] library.

The instances of "node-rdkafka" that are returned by kafka-avro are hacked so as to intercept produced and consumed messages and run them by the Avro de/serializer along with Confluent's Schema Registry Magic Byte and Schema Id.

You are highly encouraged to read the ["node-rdkafka" documentation](https://blizzard.github.io/node-rdkafka/current/), as it explains how you can use the Producer and Consumer instances as well as check out the [available configuration options of node-rdkafka](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/2213fb29f98a7a73f22da21ef85e0783f6fd67c4/CONFIGURATION.md).

### node-rdkafka CODES

The `Kafka.CODES` enumeration of constant values provided by the "node-rdkafka" library is also available as a static var at:

```js
const KafkaAvro = require('kafka-avro');

console.log(KafkaAvro.CODES);
```

### Initialize kafka-avro

```js
const KafkaAvro = require('kafka-avro');

const kafkaAvro = new KafkaAvro({
    kafkaBroker: 'localhost:9092',
    schemaRegistry: 'http://localhost:8081',
});

// Query the Schema Registry for all topic-schema's
// fetch them and evaluate them.
kafkaAvro.init()
    .then(function() {
        console.log('Ready to use');
    });
```

### Kafka-avro options

When instantiating kafka-avro you may pass the following options:

* `kafkaBroker` **String REQUIRED** The url or comma delimited strings pointing to your kafka brokers.
* `schemaRegistry` **String REQUIRED** The url to the Schema Registry.
* `schemaRegistryAuth` **Object** Basic auth object to connect to confluent cloud registry `{username: API_KEY, password: API_SECRET}`. Same as Axios basic auth [Request Config](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config) parameter.
* `topics` **Array of Strings** You may optionally define specific topics to be fetched by kafka-avro vs fetching schemas for all the topics which is the default behavior.
* `fetchAllVersions` **Boolean** Set to true to fetch all versions for each topic, use it when updating of schemas is often in your environment.
* `fetchRefreshRate` **Number** The pooling time (in seconds) to the schemas be fetched and updated in background. This is useful to keep with schemas changes in production. The default value is `0` seconds (disabled).
* `parseOptions` **Object** Schema parse options to pass to `avro.parse()`. `parseOptions.wrapUnions` is set to `true` by default.
* `httpsAgent` **Object** initialized [https Agent class](https://nodejs.org/api/https.html#https_class_https_agent)
* `shouldFailWhenSchemaIsMissing` **Boolean** Set to true if producing a message for which no AVRO schema can be found should throw an error
* `keySubjectStrategy` **String** A SubjectNameStrategy for key. It is used by the Avro serializer to determine the subject name under which the event record schemas should be registered in the schema registry. The default is TopicNameStrategy. Allowed values are [TopicRecordNameStrategy, TopicNameStrategy, RecordNameStrategy]
* `valueSubjectStrategy` **String** A SubjectNameStrategy for value. It is used by the Avro serializer to determine the subject name under which the event record schemas should be registered in the schema registry. The default is TopicNameStrategy. Allowed values are [TopicRecordNameStrategy, TopicNameStrategy, RecordNameStrategy]

### Producer

> NOTICE: You need to initialize kafka-avro before you can produce or consume messages.

By invoking the `kafkaAvro.getProducer()` method, kafka-avro will instantiate a Producer, make it connect and wait for it to be ready before the promise is resolved.

```js
kafkaAvro.getProducer({
  // Options listed bellow
})
    // "getProducer()" returns a Bluebird Promise.
    .then(function(producer) {
        const topicName = 'test';

        producer.on('disconnected', function(arg) {
          console.log('producer disconnected. ' + JSON.stringify(arg));
        });

        const value = {name:'John'};
        const key = 'key';

        // if partition is set to -1, librdkafka will use the default partitioner
        const partition = -1;
        producer.produce(topicName, partition, value, key);
    })
```

What kafka-avro basically does is wrap around node-rdkafka and intercept the produce method to validate and serialize the message.

* [Full list of Producer's options](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/2213fb29f98a7a73f22da21ef85e0783f6fd67c4/CONFIGURATION.md)

### Consumer

> NOTICE: You need to initialize kafka-avro before you can produce or consume messages.

By invoking the `kafkaAvro.getConsumer()` method, kafka-avro will instantiate a Consumer, listen on log, error and disconnect events and return it to you. Depending on the consuming pattern you follow you may or may not need to perform a `connect()`.

#### Consumer using events to consume

When consuming topics using the `data` event you will need to perform a `connect()` as per node-rdkafka documentation:

```js
kafkaAvro.getConsumer({
  'group.id': 'librd-test',
  'socket.keepalive.enable': true,
  'enable.auto.commit': true,
})
  // the "getConsumer()" method will return a bluebird promise.
  .then(function(consumer) {
    // Perform a consumer.connect()
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
      consumer.on('ready', function() {
        resolve(consumer);
      });

      consumer.connect({}, function(err) {
        if (err) {
          reject(err);
          return;
        }
        resolve(consumer); // depend on Promises' single resolve contract.
      });
    });
  })
  .then(function(consumer) {
    // Subscribe and consume.
    const topicName = 'test';
    consumer.subscribe([topicName]);
    consumer.consume();
    consumer.on('data', function(rawData) {
      console.log('data:', rawData);
    });
  });
```

#### Consumer using streams to consume

```js
kafkaAvro.getConsumerStream({
  'group.id': 'librd-test',
  'socket.keepalive.enable': true,
  'enable.auto.commit': true,
},
{
  'request.required.acks': 1
},
{
  'topics': 'test'
})
  .then(function(stream) {
      stream.on('error', function(err) {
        if (err) console.log(err);
        process.exit(1);
      });

      stream.on('data', function (rawData) {
          console.log('data:', rawData)
      });

      stream.on('error', function(err) {
        console.log(err);
        process.exit(1);
      });

      stream.consumer.on('event.error', function(err) {
        console.log(err);
      })
  });
```


Same deal here, thin wrapper around node-rdkafka and deserialize incoming messages before they reach your consuming method.

* [node-rdkafka Consumer Tutorial](https://blizzard.github.io/node-rdkafka/current/tutorial-consumer.html)
* [Full list of Consumer's options](https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka/blob/2213fb29f98a7a73f22da21ef85e0783f6fd67c4/CONFIGURATION.md)

#### Consumer Data Object

kafka-avro intercepts all incoming messages and augments the object with two more properties named `parsed` and `parsedKey`, which contained the avro deserialized object's value and key. Here is a breakdown of the properties included in the `message` object you receive when consuming messages:

* `value` **Buffer** The raw message buffer from Kafka.
* `size` **Number** The size of the message.
* `key` **String|Number** Partioning key used.
* `topic` **String** The topic this message comes from.
* `offset` **Number** The Kafka offset.
* `partition` **Number** The kafka partion used.
* `parsed` **Object** The avro deserialized value as a JS Object ltieral.
* `schemaId` **Number** The Registry Value Schema id of the consumed message.
* `parsedKey` **Object** The avro deserialized key as a JS Object ltieral.
* `schemaIdKey` **Number** The Registry Key Schema id of the consumed message.

The KafkaAvro instance also provides the following methods:

### Support for several event types in the same topic
Kafka Avro can support several events types in the same topic. This requires using TopicRecordNameStrategy strategy.

```js
const KafkaAvro = require('kafka-avro');

const kafkaAvro = new KafkaAvro({
    kafkaBroker: 'localhost:9092',
    schemaRegistry: 'http://localhost:8081',
    keySubjectStrategy: "TopicRecordNameStrategy",
    valueSubjectStrategy: "TopicRecordNameStrategy",
});

// Query the Schema Registry for all topic-schema's
// fetch them and evaluate them.
kafkaAvro.init()
    .then(function() {
        console.log('Ready to use');
    });
```

You can read more about this here : https://www.confluent.io/blog/put-several-event-types-kafka-topic/

### Logging

The Kafka Avro library logs messages using the [Bunyan logger](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/). To enable logging you will have to define at least one of the needed ENV variables:

* `KAFKA_AVRO_LOG_LEVEL` Set it a valid Bunyan log level value to activate console logging (Typically you'd need either `info` or `debug` as values.)
* `KAFKA_AVRO_LOG_NO_COLORS` Set this to any value to disable color when logging.


#### KafkaAvro.getLogger()

> **WARNING** The logger will not emit any messages as it was expected, there is an [open issue on Bunyan's repository](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/issues/479) pending a solution on this. So no logging for now.


> **NOTICE** This is a **static method** on the `KafkaAvro` constructor, not the instance. Therefore there is a single logger instance for the whole runtime.

**Returns** {Bunyan.Logger} [Bunyan logger](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan/) instance.

```js
const KafkaAvro = require('kafka-avro');
const fmt = require('bunyan-format');

const kafkaLog  = KafkaAvro.getLogger();

kafkaLog.addStream({
    type: 'stream',
    stream: fmt({
        outputMode: 'short',
        levelInString: true,
    }),
    level: 'info',
});
```

### Helper Methods

#### kafkaAvro.serialize(type, schemaId, value)

Serialize the provided value with Avro, including the magic Byte and schema id provided.

**Returns** {Buffer} Serialized buffer message.

* `type` {avsc.Type} The avro type instance.
* `schemaId` {number} The Schema Id in the SR.
* `value` {*} Any value to serialize.

#### kafkaAvro.deserialize(type, message)

Deserialize the provided message, expects a message that includes Magic Byte and schema id.

**Returns** {*} Deserialized message.

* `type` {avsc.Type} The avro type instance.
* `message` {Buffer} Message in byte code.
